**Constraint:**
- For all GitHub operations, prefer GitHub CLI (`gh`) as the primary tool.
- If `gh` is not available or cannot be used, use an available GitHub MCP server as fallback.
- If neither `gh` nor a GitHub MCP server is available, stop and return a failed result explaining that required GitHub tools are missing.
- Read project.mdc file
- First, load all the rules for the cursor editor (.cursor/rules/.*mdc).
- Always apply @.cursor/skills/smartest-project-addition/SKILL.md internally to identify one highest-impact, low-risk addition candidate; include it only if it maps to a real finding and keep the final output in the required findings-only format.
- Switch to the main branch and make sure you have the updated main branch. Then switch to the branch where the PR is and, to be on the safe side, update the branch for the PR as well, then continue with the code review.
- I want the texts to be in the language in which the task was assigned. Never combine multiple languages in your answer, e.g., one part in English and the other in Czech.
- All comments or outputs posted to GitHub (issues, pull requests, review comments, and PR descriptions) must be written in English.
- Always load existing CR reports/comments in the PR and related issue before generating a new CR report, and never repeat a previously reported finding.
- Explicitly detect and report **DRY violations** (duplicated logic, duplicated validation rules, repeated branching/condition blocks, and copy-pasted code paths) in every CR result.
- **Before starting the review**, analyze all comments and discussions in the issue so that you fully understand what the final state should be and what logic should have been created. Only then begin reviewing.
- NEVER CHANGE THE CODE! Generate the output only.
- All messages formatted as markdown for output.
- Analyze all comments in the issue and create a list of tasks from the assignment and comments so that you can resolve all issues, if they have not already been resolved.

**Steps:**
- **Cancel CR if PR has conflicts!** If the PR has merge conflicts with the base branch, do not perform the code review; cancel and report that the CR was skipped due to conflicts.
- Switch locally to the branch in PR and perform code review over changes locally on the filesystem.
- Before writing findings, collect prior review comments/reports from the PR timeline and related issue discussion. Build a dedup list by problem signature (file/scope + root cause + risk) and skip findings already reported unless severity/impact changed.
- **Plan Alignment Analysis:** Compare the implementation against the original issue description, planning documents, or step description. Identify deviations from the planned approach, architecture, or requirements. Assess whether deviations are justified improvements or problematic departures. Verify that all planned functionality has been implemented — list any missing or only partially met items.
- First, load all the rules for the cursor editor (.cursor/rules/.*mdc).
- Before resolving a task, always switch to the main branch, download the latest changes, and make sure you have the latest code in the main branch.
- Always apply @.cursor/skills/code-review/SKILL.md and @.cursor/skills/security-review/SKILL.md. If the changes include any database-related modifications (migrations, schema changes, repositories, raw SQL, query builder, or Eloquent/queries in changed code), also apply @.cursor/skills/mysql-problem-solver/SKILL.md for those parts; otherwise do not use the SQL skill. Find the issue by code or URL on GitHub.
- **Race condition review (when shared state is modified):** If the changes contain any of the following signals — read-modify-write sequences, shared counters/balances/stock/quotas, `firstOrCreate`/`updateOrCreate`, retried or re-dispatched jobs that mutate shared records, cache write-back patterns, or bulk read-then-write operations — apply @.cursor/skills/race-condition-review/SKILL.md. If none of these signals are present, skip this step.
- **I/O bottleneck review (when changes touch file, storage, or external I/O):** If the changes include any of the following signals — synchronous file reads/writes on large or unbounded files, blocking HTTP calls without timeouts, storage operations executed in the request lifecycle, large file responses not streamed, or export/import operations loading all records into memory — flag each occurrence and recommend the appropriate async/streaming pattern. If none of these signals are present, skip this step.
- **All business logic is allowed only in classes that follow the action pattern!**
- **Invokeable controller rule (**Critical**):** Any controller method that is not a standard CRUD method (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`) must be a dedicated single-action invokeable controller exposing only `__invoke()`. Resource controllers must not contain non-CRUD methods — flag as **Critical** if found.
- **Action pattern (only when `vendor/pekral/arch-app-services` exists):** Apply @.cursor/skills/refactor-entry-point-to-action/SKILL.md rules when reviewing PHP entry points (controllers, jobs, commands, listeners, **Livewire components**). Flag violations as **Critical** in the CR report.
- **Livewire component structure (only in Livewire projects):** Livewire components must be split into a PHP class (`app/Livewire/`) and a Blade view (`resources/views/livewire/`). Single-file (Volt) components are forbidden — flag as **Critical**. Business logic in Livewire component methods must be delegated to Action classes — flag inline business logic as **Critical**.
- **Data Validator pattern (only when `vendor/pekral/arch-app-services` exists):** If an Action throws `ValidationException` directly or calls `Validator::make()` inline, flag it as **Critical**. Validation must be delegated to a Data Validator class in `app/DataValidators/{Domain}/`.
- **BaseModelService pattern (only when `vendor/pekral/arch-app-services` exists):** All services that primarily work with a specific Eloquent Model must extend `BaseModelService` and implement `getModelManager()`, `getRepository()`, and `getModelClass()`. If a service works with a model but does not extend `BaseModelService`, flag it as **Critical**. If a service does not primarily serve a single model but exists as a plain service class, flag it as **Moderate** and recommend refactoring to an Action pattern class.
- **Laravel AI SDK (**Critical**):** If a Laravel project implements AI features (e.g., LLM calls, embeddings, agents) without using the [Laravel AI SDK](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/ai-sdk) — for example by calling AI provider APIs directly via raw HTTP or a non-Laravel SDK — flag it as **Critical** and recommend migrating to the Laravel AI SDK.
- Find the Git branch and switch to it.
- If possible, find links to the assignment and analyze it so you can do a quality CR. For GitHub sources, use GitHub CLI (`gh`) first; if `gh` is not available, use a GitHub MCP server; if neither is available, stop and return a failed result about missing GitHub tools.
- List findings using exactly three severity levels: **Critical**, **Moderate**, **Minor**.
- If there are any findings, add comments to the PR about where you found these errors. If that is not possible, create a new comment on the PR with the list of findings. If you do not find any issues, post a short comment stating that **no findings were identified**. Every text in English.
- I want you to use the console cli tool to insert the CR result into the GitHub PR as a new comment. The PR comment must contain **only findings** grouped by severity (Critical → Moderate → Minor), each with file/line (or file) and a short, actionable recommendation. Do not include any summary, “what was checked”, or praise.
- Use readable Markdown with clear section separators and include short code suggestions for simple fixes when helpful.
- Run the tests and let me know if the current changes meet the requirements. If so, add a new comment to the issue with brief testing recommendations and include direct in-app links (full URLs) for each recommendation so testers can click through immediately. If the requirements are not met or you have found critical errors, just list them for me.
- If needed, use browser-based testing via available browser MCP tools
- If all **Critical** and **Moderate** findings from the current CR cycle are resolved, run @.cursor/skills/test-like-human/SKILL.md before closing the review flow (when the changes are testable).

**Communication protocol:**
- Do not include praise/positive feedback; output must contain only findings.
- If you find significant deviations from the plan or requirements, explicitly flag them and ask for confirmation.
- If you identify issues with the original plan or requirements themselves, recommend updates.
- For implementation problems, provide clear guidance on fixes needed with code examples.

**After completing the tasks**
- Keep @.cursor/skills/test-like-human/SKILL.md as a required final step only after **Critical** and **Moderate** findings are resolved and the changes are testable.
- Based on the discussion in the assignment, is the proposed solution to the problems safe and effective? Analyze the assignment and all discussions related to this task and write me your conclusion!

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
