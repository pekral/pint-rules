# Answer PR Questions

**Constraint:**
- For all GitHub operations, prefer GitHub CLI (`gh`) as the primary tool.
- If `gh` is not available or cannot be used, use an available GitHub MCP server as fallback.
- If neither `gh` nor a GitHub MCP server is available, stop and return a failed result explaining that required GitHub tools are missing.
- First, load all the rules for the cursor editor (`.cursor/rules/.*mdc`).
- Read `project.mdc` before starting.
- Analyze both issue and pull request discussions from the provided link.
- Work only with questions relevant to the current PR and current issue state.
- Ignore questions that were already clearly answered in the same issue/PR context.
- Output must be understandable for non-programmers (project manager or client).
- Output must be in the language in which the assignment was written.

**Steps:**
- Open the provided issue link and identify its current branch/related PR.
- Collect all comments from:
  - the issue timeline,
  - the related PR timeline,
  - PR review comments and review threads.
- Build a list of all current stakeholder questions.
- Filter out questions that are already answered.
- Keep only unanswered and still relevant questions for the current PR.
- For each remaining question, prepare one short unified final answer:
  - no technical jargon,
  - clear business meaning,
  - maximum 2-4 short sentences.
- If a question cannot be fully answered from available information, explicitly state what is still missing and who should provide it.

**Output format (markdown):**
- Use this structure so answers can be copied easily:

```markdown
## Nezodpovězené otázky a sjednocené odpovědi

### 1) <Krátká formulace otázky>
**Sjednocená odpověď:** <Krátká finální odpověď pro PM/klienta>

### 2) <Krátká formulace otázky>
**Sjednocená odpověď:** <Krátká finální odpověď pro PM/klienta>
```

- If there are no unanswered relevant questions, return:

```markdown
## Nezodpovězené otázky a sjednocené odpovědi

V aktuálním issue a souvisejícím PR nejsou žádné nezodpovězené otázky.
```

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
