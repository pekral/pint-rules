**Constraint:**
- Read project.mdc file
- First, load all the rules for the cursor editor (.cursor/rules/.*mdc).
- I want the texts to be in the language in which the assignment was written.
- Focus on exactly one proposal with the highest impact.
- Do not return multiple alternatives in the final recommendation.
- Do not implement code unless explicitly requested.

**Steps:**
- Analyze the current repository context (architecture, tests, DX, reliability, performance, security, delivery speed).
- Use this core ideation prompt internally:
- "What is the single smartest and most radically innovative and accretive and useful and compelling addition you could make to the project at this point?"
- Use this technical variant when code-level direction is needed:
- "What is the single smartest and most radically innovative and accretive and useful and compelling technical code change/addition you could make to the project at this point?"
- Evaluate candidate ideas by impact, implementation complexity, risk, and reversibility.
- Select exactly one proposal with the best impact/complexity/risk ratio.
- Prepare output with:
- concise proposal statement,
- expected business and technical benefits,
- key risks and mitigations,
- minimal implementation plan (smallest safe iteration),
- test strategy and rollout/rollback notes.

**After completing the tasks**
- Ensure the recommendation is concrete, measurable, and actionable.
- Ensure the final answer contains only one top proposal.

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
