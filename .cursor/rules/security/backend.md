## General Secure Coding Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use error handling without revealing sensitive information.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in API responses.
- Do not hardcode any secrets (credentials, API keys, etc) in the source code or configuration files.

## HTTP Security headers and Cookies
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect against XSS and clickjacking attacks.
- Set cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.
- Enforce strict CORS policies for cookies.

### CSRF Protection
Apply the following rules only if authentication relies on cookies instead of tokens.
- Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
- Validate `Origin` and `Referer` headers for non-GET requests.
- Require re-authentication before performing sensitive actions.

## Output Rendering
- Ensure output is encoded correctly for the corresponding context.
- Escape special characters in output to prevent injection attacks.

## Database
- Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent injections.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- Handle sensitive data properly.
- Monitor security issues.
- Apply the principle of least privilege to database users.

## API Security
- Apply authentication and integrity checks on all API requests.
- Configure CORS policies to restrict cross-origin access to trusted domains only.
- Apply rate limiting to manage traffic.
- Enforce security headers.
- Handle errors securely without revealing sensitive details to end users.
- Log access and actions for monitoring, auditing, and detecting abnormal activity.

## External Requests
- Restrict outbound requests to only necessary external services and internal endpoints.
- Use allowlists to define permitted destinations instead of blocking known bad domains.
- Disable unnecessary URL fetching capabilities in your application.
- Validate and sanitize all user-supplied URLs before making requests.
- Implement request timeouts and rate limits to prevent abuse.
