## General Secure Coding Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use error handling without revealing sensitive information.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in API responses.
- Do not hardcode any secrets (credentials, API keys, etc) in the source code or configuration files.
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when performing database queries.

## WebView Usage
- Limit WebView access to trusted URLs, and disable JavaScript by default.
- Enforce HTTPS in WebView to prevent loading insecure content.
- Regularly clear WebView data (cache, cookies) to reduce the risk of leakage.
- Validate and sanitize input data to prevent malicious scripts from being executed in WebViews.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded into WebViews.
