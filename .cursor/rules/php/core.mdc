## Tech Stack
- Defined in composer.json

## AI Behavior
- No apologies, no invented changes
- Preserve existing code, don't remove unrelated logic
- Verify before presenting, no speculation
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed
